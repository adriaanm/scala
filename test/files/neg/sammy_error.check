sammy_error.scala:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : F1[Any,Nothing]
 required: F1[Any,Any]
Note: Nothing <: Any, but trait F1 is invariant in type B.
You may wish to define B as +B instead. (SLS 4.5)
  foo(x => x) // should result in only one error (the second one stemmed from adapting to SAM when the tree was erroneous)
